    "    The threading module in Python is used to work with threads, allowing you to create and manage threads within your Python programs. Threads are lightweight sub-processes that can run concurrently, making it possible to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

    "Improved Performance: Multithreading can utilize multiple CPU cores, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks, improving execution speed.\n",

    "Responsiveness: Multithreading enhances the responsiveness of applications, as threads can perform tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.\n",

    "5. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other(s) to release a resource or take some action. Deadlocks can lead to a program's complete halt, where no progress is possible. They typically occur in situations involving multiple locks or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Thread A holds Resource X and waits for Resource Y, while Thread B holds Resource Y and waits for Resource X. Both threads are stuck, and the program is deadlocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition: A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the timing or order of execution. It leads to unpredictable behavior and can result in data corruption or unexpected results. Race conditions are often the result of improper synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Two threads concurrently increment a shared counter. Without proper synchronization, the counter may end up with an incorrect value because the threads read and modify it simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these issues, proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, should be used in multithreaded programs to ensure that threads can access shared resources safely and prevent deadlocks and race conditions."
